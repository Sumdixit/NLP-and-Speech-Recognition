    "The goal is to understand and implement the essential steps of text preprocessing using Python. The notebook covers data cleaning tasks like tokenization, case normalization, spelling correction, POS tagging, and NER. It also includes stemming, lemmatization, and noise removal, such as stopwords, URLs, punctuations, and emoticons, to prepare text data for NLP applications."
